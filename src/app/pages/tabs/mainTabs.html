      You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that
      the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma,
      whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

      The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them as
      believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who
      will be sharing the adventure with them.
